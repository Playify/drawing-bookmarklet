# Drawing Bookmarklet

![Demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11f3ee1d-6f4d-46dd-8359-1ac2ffb7565a)

This bookmarklet provides an easy and intuitive way to draw over web pages, with tons of customization.

While in drawing mode, <u>**press H**</u> to view all features.

To exit drawing mode, press the escape key or click the bookmarklet again.

## Usage

To add the bookmarklet to your bookmark bar, head over to https://simondmc.com/drawing-bookmarklet since Markdown does not
support JavaScript links.

## Safety

Bookmarklets are generally dangerous as they get full access to any page you run them on. This bookmarklet makes zero network
requests and works perfectly fine while offline (unless the remote version is installed).

As the minified version is hard to read and it's therefore difficult to verify its trustworthiness, you are more than welcome
to read through the [unminified version](https://github.com/SimonDMC/drawing-bookmarklet/blob/main/drawing.js) and run it
through a minifier of your choice (for example [Terser](https://try.terser.org/)).

This also means absolutely no telemetry data is collected. If you find it useful, consider starring the project!
